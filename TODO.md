# TO DOs

*random things that I can do to improve the app*

## User Interface

Better colors for light and dark mode.  Primary red/green/blue are too jarring.

SVG images for backgrounds, other places.  Replace the ugly UI with more sweeping curves, angles,
and colors.

Have a spinny thing on the UI next to the progress bar to show that the app is doing something.


## Android Auto

Support Android auto somehow: allow the app to appear on android auto "head" display in car.

Android Auto buttons, or handle voice input.


## Settings

Settings pop-up from upper-right "..." menu

Set phone number with text box or pick from phone-resident Contact.


Profiles: each profile has a name, txt message templates, time range, other things like icon/emoji,
color.  Main window has list of Profiles with floating "+" at bottom-right to create a new one.
Tapping a Profile edits it, each row has a "Start" button.



## Notification Banners

Check-in button on the Notification banner

Add picture of person getting paged on notification that a TXT msg is being sent.

Better coloring and styling with app logo and/or emojis on Notification banners



# TXT Messages

Support sending to mulitple people in a group or backups for fall-back if the first person can't
be sent (use Intents on smsManager).

Support Google Chat as primary or backup


## History

History DB with scrolling screen and search window


## Cloud

Support phones sending updates to a cloud web service.  If phone can't send text messages and tell
the cloud that it did, the cloud will react and send messages saying the phone is probably having
problems or turned off/died.
